Hi!

I knew you would do it.
If you are reading this message, it means that you use your brain to think, and not just follow weird instructions.
You’ll become a great programmer!

In this project, you can create your own classes and run them.
Create classes in separate packages, so they do not conflict with each other.

To run a class, just press Ctrl + Shift + F10
(class must contain a method main)


To make your life easier, I wrote a plugin for Intellij IDEA. Use it to solve JavaRush tasks and check them.
It's very easy to install it:
1 Run Intellij IDEA
2 Press Ctrl + Alt + S
3 Press «Install plugin from disk»
4 Select the file "JavaRushIdeaPlugin/lib/IdeaPlugin.jar" from the archive where this document is

If something goes wrong, you can always install the plugin by yourself.
Just copy JavaRushIdeaPlugin directory with all files it has to the folder where your Intellij IDEA is located, into the subdirectory “plugins”.
Most likely, this path looks like this:
C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 14.0.3\plugins

After installation of plugin, restart the Intellij IDEA.


If you’ve installed the plugin correctly, you will see in top menu of Intellij IDEA two additional buttons: 5th and 6th buttons on the right.
Use the left button to choose a task for solving. All tasks shown there are available to you at the moment.
Use the second button to send the task to the server for checking.
