/* The tale of the Little Red Riding Hood
1. There are five classes: Red Riding Hood, grandmother, patty, woodcutter, wolf.
    2. Each class has two fields of ArrayList type: killed and ate.
    3. Necessary objects are already created (hood, grandmother, ...).
    4. Create the correct relationship (who ate and killed whom) to get the logic of the «Little Red Riding Hood».
