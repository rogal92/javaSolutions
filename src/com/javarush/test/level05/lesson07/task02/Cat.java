/* Create a class Cat
Create a class Cat with five initializers:
    - Name
    - Name, weight, age
    - Name, age (standard weight)
    - Weight, color, (name, address and age are unknown, it’s an alley cat)
    - Weight, color, address (it’s someone’s house cat)
    Initializer’s task is to make an object valid. For example, if the weight is unknown, you need to specify some average weight. A cat can’t have any weight at all, likewise age. But it can have no name (null). The same applies to the address - can be null.
